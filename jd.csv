About Us



KRAVE is the original premium meat snack brand, founded in 2010 by Jon Sebastiani who was in search of a better-for-you high-protein snack when training for the NYC Marathon. Unable to find one commercially available among a meat snacks category that was once dominated by conventional brands, KRAVE was founded to modernize the meat snacks category through culinary-inspired flavor profiles, premium protein sources, elevated claims, and a proprietary cook process that results in a distinctly tender eating experience.


Chef’s Cut was similarly an early pioneer within the better-for-you meat snacks category. Founded in 2012 by pro-golfer Dennis Riedel and his Chef looking for a healthy and delicious meat snack to enjoy while out on the golf course. Riedel and Chef scaled the brand from the country club to every major retail channel, on a mission to deliver a ‘steakhouse quality experience, outside of the steakhouse’ at an approachable price point, with its thicker jerky cuts and traditional flavor profiles. 



Through acquisition, KRAVE and Chef’s Cut are now jointly owned and operated. The combined portfolio represents premium, ultra-premium, and value segments within the meat snacks category – currently the fastest growing segment within total US snacking. KRAVE and Chef’s Cut’s stick and jerky offerings are available in 25,000+ stores nationwide, with key retailers that include Whole Foods Market, Sprouts, Costco, Albertsons, Kroger, Meijer and more.
